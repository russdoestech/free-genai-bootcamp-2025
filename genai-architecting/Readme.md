## Functional Requirement

The company wants to explore developing the genai language tutor on a variety of different LLMs in an effort to avoid vendor lock-in and rug-pulls, in anticipation of increased costs in the gen ai space.

To that end we explored building the genai language tutor using Meta AI, Chat GPT, and Claude.

## Choosing a model

Going forward, the company would strongly prefer further investigation into open-source models so that there is visibility into the reasoning the model is utilizing.
