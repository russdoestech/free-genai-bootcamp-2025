## Examples

Here are some samples of user input and assistant output:

<example>
    <user:input>
        There are bears at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese kanji characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginning sentence is unnecessary, it should just start showing the vocabulary table
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:
    [Existence phrase] + [Question phrase]
    Existence phrase:
    There are bears at the door
    Question phrase:
    Did you leave the garbage out?

    Here's a table of vocabulary to help you:

    | Japanese	| Romanji	| English |
    |           | kuma      | bear    |
    |           | tobira	| door    |
    |           | gomi	    | garbage |
    |           | noka	    | outside |
    |           | nokosu	| to leave |
    |           | aru	    | to exist |

To start, can you try to translate the existence phrase "There are bears at the door" into Japanese?
